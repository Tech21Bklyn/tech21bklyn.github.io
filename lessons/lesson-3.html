        <div class="info smaller-text">
          <p>These sites are typically based an individual's personal interests.</p>
          <p>Blog posts are made of a fairly regular basis to provide new content or updates on the topics that the creator wants to share information about or demonstrate expertise in.</p>
          <p>A vlog is a type of blog that uses video content instead of writing.</p>
          <p>Examples of platforms that are used for Blogging/Vlogging:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>WordPress</li>

        <div class="info smaller-text">
          <p>A personal portfolio or gallery can be used to showcase your abilities to potential clients or to apply to schools, scholarship programs, internships, and jobs.</p>
          <p>Galleries with work samples help people assess the creator's style and capabilities and differentiate him or her from others.</p>
          <p>A resume is sometimes included, especially if the portfolio is designed to be viewed as part of an application process.</p>

        <h3>Business or Non-Profit site</h3>

        <div class="info smaller-text">
          <p>Websites attract potential customers, volunteers, or donors. They tell the story behind organizations and the services they offer.</p>
          <p>Additionally, business information is listed in directories such as Google, FourSquare, and Yelp to aid discovery by customers.</p>
          <p>There are many ways to create and host websites including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Custom website development, with or without a framework</li>

      <p class="info">
        This section includes descriptions of design principles and best practices for making websites more attractive and useful to users.

      <div class="info">

          <li>Spacing between elements that draws the viewer's eyes to the most important parts of the page.</li>
          <li>Consistency in spacing around elements and text.</li>
          <li>Example: Google's search page vs. <a href="https://www.webpagefx.com/blog/web-design/popular-search-engines-in-the-90s-then-and-now/">other search engines</a> in the early days.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="info">
        <ul>
          <li>Easy to find and clean navigation menu</li>
          <li>Indicators should let user clearly know what part of the site they are on (breadcrumbs are one technique)</li>
          <li>No dead ends. Provide ways to navigate back or to other parts of the site</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let's examine <a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> to see some of these principles in action.</p>

          ### Embedding Google Web Fonts


          <div class="info smaller-text">
            <p><a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Web Fonts</a> helps load fonts faster by downloading minimal font data and caching from site to site. Example:</p>
          </div>

          ```html
          <head>
            <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto" rel="stylesheet">
          </head>
          ```

          ```css
          .css-selector {
            font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
          }
          ```

          <div class="info smaller-text">
            <p>In <a href="https://blog.codepen.io/2012/07/18/custom-fonts-in-pens/">CodePen</a>, add an @import statement to the top of the CSS pane.</p>

        <h3>Graphics, Images, and Video</h3>

        <div class="info smaller-text">
          <p>Visuals are an important part of any website. They draw the viewer's attention to important content and convey messages in ways that words can't.</p>
          <p>Consider readability if you put text on top of the graphics. Make sure it's readable.</p>
          <p>Be mindful about copyright laws and do not use works protected by copyright without permission. We will discuss this in more detail later in the presentation.</p>

      <h3>Call to Action</h3>

      <div class="info smaller-text">
        <p>The Call to Action (CTA) encourages the site visitor to take the next step intended by the creator. It should be featured prominently on the site to encourage the behavior. CTAs may be a form or button that encourages the user to do things such as:</p>

          <p>A license is an agreement between two parties that authorizes the use of some intellectual property that is protected by law.</p>
          <p>Licenses may be for a term or perpetual (forever). An example is an End-User License Agreement (EULA) that you must accept when you install software or sign up to use a website.</p>
          <p>Other examples include a license to publish photographs, videos, graphics, or music. You grant social media companies a license when you publish your photos on their apps based on the terms of their EULAs.</p>

        <h3>What are Trademarks?</h3>

        <div class="info smaller-text">
          <p>Trademarks protect some categories that are not covered by copyrights. They are designed to distinguish sources of goods, such as a logo printed on packaging or marketing material.</p>
          <p>Trademarks also include service marks, which are words, phrases, symbols, or designs that distinguishes the source of a service.</p>
          <p>Trademarks registered with the US Patent and Trademark Office use the &reg; symbol. Unregistered trademarks use the &trade; symbol.</p>

        <h3>What is Fair Use?</h3>

        <div class="info smaller-text">
          <p>
            Fair Use is an exception in US Copyright law that permits limited reproduction of a copyrighted work for purposes such as "criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research" -

        <h3>Fair Use Continued</h3>

        <div class="info smaller-text">
          <p>When someone is sued for copyright infringement, the courts may consider four factors when evaluating whether the infringement is protected by fair use:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Purpose and character of the use, including whether the use is commercial in nature or for nonprofit educational purposes</li>
            <li>Nature of the copyrighted work - less likely to support a fair use claim for a creative or imaginative work than for a factual work</li>
            <li>Amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole</li>
            <li>Effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work</li>

        <h3>DMCA Takedown Notices</h3>

        <div class="info smaller-text">
          <p>A copyright holder can submit a takedown notice claiming that a work is infringing on a copyright. The service provider reviews the notice and makes a decision on whether or not the claim is valid. Service providers have different policies for handling this process.</p>
          <p>The DMCA has been controversial over the years with claims that it has been used improperly to censor content or stifle competition.</p>
